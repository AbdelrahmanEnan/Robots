# Robots
## Arduino Codes
[Main Code](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Robots/tree/main/MainCode) is the Main code "I guess :sweat_smile:", in which comments and explainations are provided
But [Main Code 2](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Robots/tree/main/MainCode2) is better written and the last version of the code.
The comments in the [Main Code](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Robots/tree/main/MainCode) is good for [Main Code](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Robots/tree/main/MainCode), [MainCode2](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Robots/tree/main/MainCode2), and [MainCodeNika](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Robots/tree/main/MainCodeNika).

## ESP32-CAM
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KIpFIbRMk), and [this website](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-face-recognition-arduino-ide/) contain enough instructions to stream live video to local IP adress.

While [this link](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/telegram-esp32-cam-photo-arduino/) has the instructions to capture and send photos to a telegram account.
The previous website has almost everything about ESP32-CAM.

## App Inventor
[App Inventor](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Robots/blob/main/App%20Inventor.pdf) is a pdf file that has the instructions needed to access MIT App Inventor website, and create the apps needed to control the robots. 
[Robooot.aia](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Robots/blob/main/Robooot.aia), [Nika.aia](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Robots/blob/main/Nika.aia), and [RobotGreen.aia](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Robots/blob/main/RobotGreen.aia) are the programs needed to be imported to App Inventor.
